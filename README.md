LSTM Based PDF Summarization Model 

This is a LSTM Based custom PDF Summarization that was built for my Internship at BEL Bengaluru.
The project was a team effort consequently while the code in this repository is the complete code for the model,
I personally was involved in the training and development of the Token Predicition Model.
This PDF summarization model was built from scratch.

It utilizes a 2 layered LSTM. The model has two parts:
1. The Token Prediction Model (Own)
2. The PDF Summarization Model (Team Effort)

Technologies Used: PyTorch, NLP
